Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein.

Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X-rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.

Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.

At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.)

Therefore, breast cancer has become a chronic disease and patients need to learn to live with it as well as with the adverse effects related to the disease itself or to the therapies used.

As noted in the third ""Plan cancer"", pain is a major criterion in the quality of life of patients treated for breast cancer.

Neuropathic pain was defined in 2011 by the international Association for the Study of Pain (I.A.S.P.) as the direct result of a lesion or disease affecting the somato-sensory system.

Surgical treatment is often the first treatment of breast cancer. It can be conservative by performing a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy) or non-preservative by total mastectomy.

Intercostobrachial neuralgia (NICB) or Post mastectomy painful Syndrome (MPRR) was first described by Wood in 1978 as ""chronic pain beginning immediately or early after a mastectomy"" Or a lumpectomy affecting the anterior thorax, armpit and/or arm in its upper half. These post-surgical pains are related to a lesion of the nerves in the breast area.

In particular, the intercostobrachial nerve can be severed, stretched or crushed during surgery.

Post-operative neuropathic pain in patients with breast cancer is underdiagnosed either by general practitioner or in a specialized environment.

The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is performed during examination and clinical examination. Several scales allow to detect neuropathic pain but only the DN4 is recognized to be the most specific and sensitive scale.

Patients do not always express this pain. They do not always reconcile with the surgery. Either because the pain occurs a long time after the surgery, or they find it normal to get hurt. These diagnostic difficulties cause a delay in setting up a suitable analgesic treatment.

However, neuropathic pain responds poorly to common analgesics. Diagnosis, evaluation and early management of neuropathic pain are a priority in order to avoid their chronicization, to improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and to enable them to return to work quickly.

We therefore assume that the diagnosis of early neuropathic pain at 2 months of surgery associated with initiation of appropriate topical treatment without the systemic effects of conventional oral treatments, would reduce the incidence of Chronic neuropathic pain 6 months after surgery.",no,NA

The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",yes,TNBC

In HER2 positive disease trastuzumab is given simultaneously. Neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy given simul-taneously with trastuzumab achieves a pCR rate of approx. 40%. Recent data showed that a double blockade of the HER2 receptor (e.g. trastuzumab + lapatinib; trastuzumab + pertuzumab) given together with a few cycles of chemotherapy can increase the pCR rate by approximately 20%. So far, there is uncertainty, if afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible HER family blocker can lead to an even more complete blockade of the HER2 pathway when given in combination with trastuzumab. The neoadjuvant setting provides the unique opportunity to assess precisely and at short term the effect of systemic treatment by assessing the pCR at surgery. It also allows treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer before surgery without standard trastuzumab treatment, as, according to current guideline, trastuzumab can also be given sequentially after surgery.

Nonetheless, a considerable amount of patients suffer a relapse of their cancer while on treatment with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a drug that is metabolized to a variety of compounds by the human liver, and the most important antihormonally active metabolite is called (Z)-Endoxifen. It is known that patients who have a reduced or absent activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 have lower levels of (Z)-Endoxifen. Furthermore, it has been observed that patients on tamoxifen therapy who have absent CYP2D6 activity are at a 2-fold increased risk for disease recurrence, and patients with lower CYP2D6 compared to patients with normal CYP2D6 activity still have a 1.4-fold increased risk for disease recurrence.

This trial will include patients who are already on tamoxifen therapy for at least 3 months and is designed to show that in patients with absent or low CYP2D6 activity, (Z)-Endoxifen supplementation - that is giving (Z)-Endoxifen in addition to tamoxifen for the study period of 42 days - can increase blood levels of (Z)-Endoxifen to therapeutic concentrations.

Raloxifene is a drug that is related to estrogen. In the liver and bone, it acts like estrogen. In the breast and uterus it acts like an anti-estrogen. It has been used in postmenopausal women to prevent a disease called osteoporosis. This is a disease that decreases bone strength over many years and may finally lead to bone fractures. In a group of women who were taking the drug, it also seemed to decrease the chances of breast cancer and possibly endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus). Therefore, we want to study it further to see if it prevents breast cancer. We also want to find out if it may be even better in preventing breast cancer if it is given with another drug.

The other drug in this trial is exemestane. Exemestane is a type of drug that works to decrease estrogen levels in postmenopausal women.

Letrozole and fulvestrant are anti-hormonal drugs that have been proven to have activity and are considered standard therapies for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination therapy of letrozole (an anti-hormonal drug) and lenvatinib (a targeted therapy), when compared to another anti-hormonal drug fulvestrant, is effective in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

Preliminary studies have shown that approximately 50-60% of hormone receptor positive breast cancers over-express RET, and may therefore respond to treatment by a drug that blocks the RET pathway. An earlier study conducted at the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) on the combination of letrozole and Lenvatinib has shown promising results. Among patients in whom hormonal therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor no longer worked, about one-quarter of patients had meaningful disease control. The study also showed that patients tolerated the combination of Lenvatinib and letrozole well with manageable side effects.

Based on the promising findings from the earlier study, this study seeks to compare the effectiveness of lenvatinib plus letrozole with another standard anti-hormone treatment drug called fulvestrant.

- The experimental drug AT13387 has been shown to have some anticancer effects against tumor cells by blocking a protein that affects other proteins inside certain cancer cells, and helps to prevent the cancer cells from reproducing and spreading. AT13387 has not been tested in humans, and researchers are interested in investigating whether it can be used to treat solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.

Objectives:

- To investigate the safety and effectiveness of AT13387 in individuals with solid tumors.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well as blood tests and tumor imaging studies.
* AT13387 will be given in 28-day cycles of treatment. Participants will receive AT13387 twice a week (2 days in a row) for the first 3 weeks of the cycle, followed by a fourth week without the drug.
* Participants will have regular blood and urine samples, imaging studies, eye examinations, and tumor biopsies to monitor the effects of the treatment.

Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching and rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant efficacy. Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of radiation dermatitis.

Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients undergoing radiation therapy.

One step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins. Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2 enzyme, leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in inflammation.

The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce the ability of new tumours to grow and survive.

This type of treatment reduces the amount of oestrogen in the body, slowing the growth of cancer or stopping it altogether. One type of hormone treatment, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), works by stopping the body from making oestrogen. Currently, women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by one class of AI are switched to the other class of AI. The reason for this is that some cancer cells can become resistant to one class but are still sensitive to the other class. However, oestrogen can be made in the body by two pathways and AIs block only one of these pathways. A new drug called Irosustat can reduce the production of oestrogen in the body by blocking the second pathway. This study is investigating whether adding Irosustat to AI treatment i.e. blocking both pathways at the same time, can further reduce the amount of oestrogen in the body and therefore control the breast cancer better.

27 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by their current AI treatment will be recruited in this study from 9 United Kingdom (UK) hospitals. Eligible patients will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily in addition to the AI on which they progressed. Patients will receive Irosustat for as long as it controls their cancer or until they have side effects that stop them from taking treatment.

Therefore, breast cancer has become a chronic disease and patients need to learn to live with it as well as with the adverse effects related to the disease itself or to the therapies used.

As noted in the third ""Plan cancer"", pain is a major criterion in the quality of life of patients treated for breast cancer.

Neuropathic pain was defined in 2011 by the international Association for the Study of Pain (I.A.S.P.) as the direct result of a lesion or disease affecting the somato-sensory system.

Surgical treatment is often the first treatment of breast cancer. It can be conservative by performing a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy) or non-preservative by total mastectomy.

Intercostobrachial neuralgia (NICB) or Post mastectomy painful Syndrome (MPRR) was first described by Wood in 1978 as ""chronic pain beginning immediately or early after a mastectomy"" Or a lumpectomy affecting the anterior thorax, armpit and/or arm in its upper half. These post-surgical pains are related to a lesion of the nerves in the breast area.

In particular, the intercostobrachial nerve can be severed, stretched or crushed during surgery.

Post-operative neuropathic pain in patients with breast cancer is underdiagnosed either by general practitioner or in a specialized environment.

The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is performed during examination and clinical examination. Several scales allow to detect neuropathic pain but only the DN4 is recognized to be the most specific and sensitive scale.

Patients do not always express this pain. They do not always reconcile with the surgery. Either because the pain occurs a long time after the surgery, or they find it normal to get hurt. These diagnostic difficulties cause a delay in setting up a suitable analgesic treatment.

However, neuropathic pain responds poorly to common analgesics. Diagnosis, evaluation and early management of neuropathic pain are a priority in order to avoid their chronicization, to improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and to enable them to return to work quickly.

We therefore assume that the diagnosis of early neuropathic pain at 2 months of surgery associated with initiation of appropriate topical treatment without the systemic effects of conventional oral treatments, would reduce the incidence of Chronic neuropathic pain 6 months after surgery.",no,NA

81,NCT00433420,3,"Active, not recruiting",breast cancer,FLUOROURACIL,Thymidylate synthase inhibitor,INHIBITOR,thymidylate synthetase,TYMS,Small molecule,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as pegfilgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving combination chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without fluorouracil and/or pegfilgrastim in treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy to compare how well it works when given with or without fluorouracil and/or pegfilgrastim in treating women with node-positive breast cancer.",yes,NA

To identify patients' preference for either therapy in this trial, patients without disease progression or other reasons for early discontinuation will be asked for their treatment preference and their treatment satisfaction. To correlate patients' preference with other patient reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and throughout the study, using dedicated questionnaires.

With similarly active treatment options, it is of utmost importance to identify the treatment that has the least negative impact on the patients' quality of life.",yes,NA
