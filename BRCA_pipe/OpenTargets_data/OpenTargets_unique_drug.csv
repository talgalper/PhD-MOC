"3","NCT00001944",1,"Completed","breast cancer","TARIQUIDAR","P-glycoprotein 1 inhibitor","INHIBITOR","ENSG00000085563","ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1","ABCB1","Small molecule","Tumor resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major problem in cancer treatment. Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein.

Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X-rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.

Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.

At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.)

Physical examination, blood tests, and other procedures may be done periodically to monitor treatment."

A number of previous studies have attempted estrogenic recruitment of cancer cells (into cell cycle) to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Although some studies showed an increase in response rates in the recruitment arm, there was no benefit in time to progression or survival in any of the studies. These results may have been due to the inadequate sample size of the studies and advanced stage disease (with presumably higher fraction of inherently chemoresistant cells). The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that estrogenic recruitment of micrometastatic disease in operable breast cancer will increase the efficacy of standard adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.

Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells \[DCs\] and natural killer \[NK\] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells, which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response."

It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when administered orally in combination with anastrozole (Arimidex®), letrozole (Femara®), or exemestane (Aromasin®) to women with metastatic breast cancer."

After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.

The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel."

In order to accomplish this the investigators have designed a chemotherapy regimen whose components (or administration schedule) are associated with minimal or no alopecia and are also considered to have low emetogenic potential.

In an attempt to improve the efficacy of the regimen the investigators plan to study an alternate schedule of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate administration (metronomic chemotherapy) which appears to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore enhance the activity of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered concurrently.

In this trial the investigators aim to determine the clinical and pathologic response rate of 12 weeks of doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of PPX and capecitabine. Metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be administered during the 24 weeks of chemotherapy."

The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a pre-surgical injection of pasireotide LAR in reducing the postoperative incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles following axillary node dissection.

The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of prolonged release pasireotide on the duration of postoperative drainage, the daily drainage volume, the total drainage volume, the number of repeated lymphocele aspirations and the volume, the total volume of lymph aspirated, the incidence of postoperative febrile episodes, the length of hospital stay, and the length of time to onset of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Primary Progesterone Timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle and its impact on survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer has been extensively researched and reinvestigated by Badwe et al in the randomized clinical trial of 'Primary Progesterone Therapy for Operable Breast Cancer' at Tata Memorial Hospital. The underlying assumption was that the presence of unopposed estrogen (in follicular phase) at the time surgery may be deleterious for survival and that circulating progesterone might counteract this deleterious effect.

Vitamin D3 The most prominent physiological role of hormonally active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol), is regulation of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and bone metabolism via an intracellular receptor (VDR) which is a member of steroid thyroid hormone super-family of receptors. The VDR receptors are also found in other tissues like breast and prostate.

Vitamin D compounds have also been implicated in promotion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells and evidence suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its synthetic analogues may potentiate responsiveness of breast cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic agents.

Unfortunately, they can cause heart muscle damage, resulting in scarring, abnormal contraction and relaxation, and heart failure symptoms. This side effect occurs more frequently at higher doses, and limits the total dose that can be given to cancer patients. Eplerenone is an oral medication that prevents or reverses heart damage in other disease states, and is commonly used to treat heart failure. This study will investigate the use of eplerenone to protect the heart from these harmful side effects of doxorubicin.

Few therapies have been shown to prevent heart damage in patients receiving anthracyclines. Small studies have suggested that other heart failure medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) may reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity, but eplerenone and other drugs in its class (aldosterone antagonists) have not previously been studied. Eplerenone inhibits enzyme pathways that cause scarring of the heart, and animal studies suggest that anthracyclines cause damage through these same pathways.

This study aims to investigate whether eplerenone protects the heart from the harmful effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy. Specifically, it will measure the effect that eplerenone has on heart muscle relaxation. It will randomly assign women undergoing chemotherapy with doxorubicin to one of two groups: one group will receive eplerenone, and the other group will receive placebo (sugar) pills. The subjects will not know which type of pills they are taking. Heart muscle relaxation will be measured at baseline, after completion of chemotherapy (8-12 weeks), and after 6 months. There will also be various blood tests measured in the study subjects, to determine whether there might be certain blood tests that identify patients at particularly high risk of heart toxicity after doxorubicin therapy."

The primary objectives of this study were:

1- to evaluate the effects of orally administered reparixin on CSCs in the primary tumor and the tumoral microenvironment in an early breast cancer population:

A. CSC were measured in tissue samples by techniques that could include: ALDEFLUOR assay and assessment of CD44/CD24 by flow cytometry, or examination of RNA transcripts by RT-PCR, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1, CD44/CD24 and epithelial mesenchymal transition markers (Snail, Twist, Notch) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). CSC were defined as ALDEFLUOR positive (ALDH-1+) and/or CD44 high/CD24 low by flow cytometry or RT-PCR and IHC and by the detection of ALDH-1+ cells with or without epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor in IHC assays.

B. Serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and chemokine receptor-1 (CXCR1) levels were measured in tissue samples by IHC.

C. Measurement of markers of inflammation (interleukin-1beta \[IL-1β\], interleukin-6 \[IL-6\], interleukin-8 \[IL-8\], tumor necrosis factor-alpha \[TNF-α\], granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor \[GM-CSF\], vascular endothelial growth factor \[VEGF\], basic fibroblast growth factor \[b-FGF\] and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein \[hsCRP\]) in plasma, leukocyte subsets (enumerate T subsets, B, and natural killer/natural killer T \[NK/NKT\] cells) and study polymorphonuclear leukocyte \[PMN\] biology in peripheral blood samples. D. Measurement of markers of angiogenesis (CD31 staining), tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (CD4, CD8, NK and macrophages), autophagy (P62 and LC3 by IHC), EpCAM and EMT markers (CD326, CD45, Twist1, SNAIL1, SLUG, ZEB1, FOXC2, TG2, Akt2, P13k and CK19 by RT-PCR) and tissue cellularity (residual disease characterization in tumor bed) in tumor tissue samples.

2. To evaluate the safety of oral reparixin administered three times daily (t.i.d.) for 21 consecutive days.

The trial will be conducted in Switzerland with max. 90 patients. CR1447 has a very good safety and tolerability profile and combines two mechanisms of action, interaction with the AR and the aromatase enzyme may have a higher activity than drugs with a single mechanism and might offer the possibility of non-chemotherapy based endocrine therapy to the limited treatment options in TN-ARpos BC. Transdermal application of CR1447 might have the advantage to continuously release of 4-OHT into the blood stream, thus omitting a first pass effect.

In Phase II the main objective is to assess activity and to determine the efficacy and tolerability of CR1447. Phase II will consist of two strata, into which patients will be stratified according to their hormonal receptor status: Stratum A for patients with endocrine responsive-HER2neg disease, regardless of their AR status and Stratum B for patients with triple-negative and determined ARpos disease. Patients with triple-negative disease tested negative for AR will be excluded from the trial.

In both strata patients will be treated with 400 mg of CR1447 until disease progression, patients' wish or physicians' decision to end treatment. Biopsies of one defined metastatic lesion in those patients who gave informed consent will be performed at baseline and within the third week of treatment with CR1447.

Measurement of AR expression, expression of downstream targets of ERα, ERβ, PR, AR, angiogenesis and other translational studies as described in this protocol should help confirming the hypothesis of an increased benefit of CR1447 due to its dual action, efficacy of topical application, tolerability and in deciding whether one should proceed to a large randomized trial."

Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching and rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant efficacy. Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of radiation dermatitis.

Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients undergoing radiation therapy.

The safety of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of breast cancer.

Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the activity of Aurora A kinase, a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this protein can lead to the death of cancer cells.

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer, including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in cancer therapy, combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of the same drugs used alone."

A preliminary retrospective study shows that PPI usage in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival. The impact was most striking in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, PPIs may be repositioned as safe and effective breast cancer drugs to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.

Many of the hurdles that slow progress from target, to lead compound, to investigational agent, to standard therapy are not barriers for the PPIs. The PPIs are FDA-approved, chronically used, and well tolerated so the investigators can move quickly from the laboratory to a proof of concept clinical trial. Incorporating the PPIs into standard care will require more than the investigators propose here, but the investigators have already plotted the additional steps needed to truly impact patient care. If successful, the data gathered in this proposal will lend support to and guide development of a definitive randomized trial."

Improvements in outcomes, however, are compromised by the considerable toxicities associated with chemotherapy, the most notable being neutropenia. Neutropenia is the presence of abnormally few white blood cells, leading to increase susceptibility to infection and can require hospitalization and need for intravenous antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile neutropenia (FN) can also be associated with treatment delays and dose reductions, potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients can receive medication to reduce the risk of FN such as Neupogen (filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5, 7 or 10 days. Since there is genuine uncertainty among healthcare professionals as to which administration schedule of Neupogen is the best for patients, the investigators are performing a randomized study for which patients will receive either 5, 7 or 10 days of Neupogen. Neupogen can cost approximately $200/injection, so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of treatment, this can cost $16,000 compared to a 5 day treatment which would cost half this. In addition to cost savings, many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a daily basis and require nursing resources which are utilized at high cost. This study will use an oral consent model to compare 5, 7 and 10 days of Neupogen to evaluate rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization."

Therefore, breast cancer has become a chronic disease and patients need to learn to live with it as well as with the adverse effects related to the disease itself or to the therapies used.

As noted in the third ""Plan cancer"", pain is a major criterion in the quality of life of patients treated for breast cancer.

Neuropathic pain was defined in 2011 by the international Association for the Study of Pain (I.A.S.P.) as the direct result of a lesion or disease affecting the somato-sensory system.

Surgical treatment is often the first treatment of breast cancer. It can be conservative by performing a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy) or non-preservative by total mastectomy.

Intercostobrachial neuralgia (NICB) or Post mastectomy painful Syndrome (MPRR) was first described by Wood in 1978 as ""chronic pain beginning immediately or early after a mastectomy"" Or a lumpectomy affecting the anterior thorax, armpit and/or arm in its upper half. These post-surgical pains are related to a lesion of the nerves in the breast area.

In particular, the intercostobrachial nerve can be severed, stretched or crushed during surgery.

Post-operative neuropathic pain in patients with breast cancer is underdiagnosed either by general practitioner or in a specialized environment.

The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is performed during examination and clinical examination. Several scales allow to detect neuropathic pain but only the DN4 is recognized to be the most specific and sensitive scale.

Patients do not always express this pain. They do not always reconcile with the surgery. Either because the pain occurs a long time after the surgery, or they find it normal to get hurt. These diagnostic difficulties cause a delay in setting up a suitable analgesic treatment.

However, neuropathic pain responds poorly to common analgesics. Diagnosis, evaluation and early management of neuropathic pain are a priority in order to avoid their chronicization, to improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and to enable them to return to work quickly.

We therefore assume that the diagnosis of early neuropathic pain at 2 months of surgery associated with initiation of appropriate topical treatment without the systemic effects of conventional oral treatments, would reduce the incidence of Chronic neuropathic pain 6 months after surgery."

Nonetheless, a considerable amount of patients suffer a relapse of their cancer while on treatment with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a drug that is metabolized to a variety of compounds by the human liver, and the most important antihormonally active metabolite is called (Z)-Endoxifen. It is known that patients who have a reduced or absent activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 have lower levels of (Z)-Endoxifen. Furthermore, it has been observed that patients on tamoxifen therapy who have absent CYP2D6 activity are at a 2-fold increased risk for disease recurrence, and patients with lower CYP2D6 compared to patients with normal CYP2D6 activity still have a 1.4-fold increased risk for disease recurrence.

This trial will include patients who are already on tamoxifen therapy for at least 3 months and is designed to show that in patients with absent or low CYP2D6 activity, (Z)-Endoxifen supplementation - that is giving (Z)-Endoxifen in addition to tamoxifen for the study period of 42 days - can increase blood levels of (Z)-Endoxifen to therapeutic concentrations. It is planned to included 504 patients in this blinded, randomized trial, which will have a placebo group (receiving no (Z)-Endoxifen) and two intervention groups that will receive 0, 1.5 or 3 mg (Z)-Endoxifen depending on their CYP2D6 genetics or their (Z)-Endoxifen levels at the start of the study.

The trial is not designed to evaluate outcome measures (that is recurrence or survival rates) of (Z)-Endoxifen supplementation in tamoxifen treated patients, but will document the safety of the combined administration of tamoxifen and (Z)-Endoxifen."

Researchers are looking at how Parsaclisib affects the immune system. They want to learn whether and how it helps the immune system to find cancer cells to fight them.

Parsaclisib is an oral drug that limits the effects of a protein called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3K). By limiting P13K, parsaclisib can block certain cells that prevent the immune cells from working. As a result, it may help the body's immune system to fight tumors. Parsaclisib is being studied in several clinical trials to treat different types of cancers. Parsaclisib has not yet been approved by FDA for the treatment of cancer.

Studies have shown that a good way to find out how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer drugs is through a pre-operative window study. In this type of study, tissue and blood are collected before treatment. Then subjects receive a study drug for a few weeks before surgery. Blood is drawn during the course of treatment, and leftover tissue is collected during surgery. Comparing the tissue and blood before and after treatment shows the effects the study drug may have had on the tumor.

Research shows that cancers differ when you look at the DNA and RNA (genetic codes) that are inside a cancer cell. DNA and RNA carry genetic information that can determine traits in humans (such as eye color, height, reaction to treatment, etc.), as well as the traits of cancer cells. Depending on the genetic profile (particularly DNA and RNA) of the cancer, it may respond differently to parsaclisib. In this study, the investigators will look at the genetic profile of a participant's tumor by studying tissue and blood samples collected before and after receiving treatment."

Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL) remains discussed.

To date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.

Since 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.

Breast cancer is the main cause of mortality among women. The disease presents high recurrence mainly due to incomplete efficacy of primary treatment in killing all cancer cells. Therapy resistance remains a major problem in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. Half of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers contain a subpopulation of cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-expressing cells that are therapy resistant and exhibit increased cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Here, we propose a testable hypothesis that treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen or retinoic acid or a combination of the two, may result in induction or conversion of some ER-positive breast cancer cells to ER-negative cancer cells expressing the basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5) via stimulation of progesterone receptors effect, and production . Therefore, we raised an issue with the answer "" Why Antiprogestrone such Mifepristone and cyp 26 inhibitors must be combined with Tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid in the era of oncology for treating early breast cancer"" .In fact, limited evidence has indicated that induction of CK5+ cells in ERα+ breast cancer is a unique effect of progestin (Prg) but many studies have demonstrated that progesterone (P4) increases CK5+ breast cancer cells. In case-cohort study of 405 incident breast cancer cases, elevated circulating progesterone levels were associated with a 16% increase in the risk of breast cancer. A study demonstrated that tamoxifen induced progesterone receptors (PGR) in short term treatment. Another study showed that High progesterone receptor expression correlates to the effect of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients. These CK5-positive cells are therapy resistant and have increased tumor-initiating potential. Also, previous work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive cells which are therapy resistant . Although retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. A study investigated the effects of all-trans-RA (atRA) on progesterone production in immature rat GCs cultured without gonadotropin. demonstrated that atRA enhanced progesterone production by upregulating the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450scc (Cyp11a1). Here, we suggest that tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid must be combined with anti-progesterone (Mifepristone) to achieve treatment with significant effect against early breast cancer. Moreover, Numerous studies have shown that CYP2D6 variant carriers (around 50% CYP2D6 variant carriers in Chinese population) will not benefit a lot from tamoxifen, and combined use of CYP2D6 inhibitors will further affect the efficacy of tamoxifen. In addition, All-trans-retinoic acid acts as an inducer of CYP26A1 expression. Which is the second expected cause of unsuccessful trial of Tamoxifen and retinoic acid in breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, The CYP26 inhibitor also induced expression of atRA-responsive genes. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in microsomes isolated from JEG-3 human placental carcinoma cells.

Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer."
