NCT ID,Brief Summary
NCT05732064,"Breast cancer patients often have sleep disturbances during the perioperative period. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic effects. Previous studies showed that night-time low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion improved sleep quality. Esketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist and has been used as an anesthetic and analgesic. Recent studies showed that low-dose esketamine has anti-depressive and sleep-promoting effects. The investigators suppose that low-dose dexmedetomidine-esketamine combined nasal administration at night can improve perioperative sleep quality in patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery."
NCT00172029,"The aim of this prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentric clinical study is to assess the effícacy and tolerability of zoledronic acid 4 mg IV infused over 15 minutes every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions, in combination with standard or reduced dose radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer and metastatic bone disease associated with pain."
NCT05131841,To compare pharmacokinetics Index of Cipterbin combined with Vinorelbine Injection every week or every three weeks in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
NCT03511378,The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity of Peg-filgrastim versus Neulasta® as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer
NCT04248179,"The investigators have developed a novel ultrasound-guided nerve block indicated primarily for breast cancer surgery that mimic a thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) - hitherto the internationally accepted regional anesthesia golden standard for anesthesia of the hemithorax - but hypothetically without the risks of adverse events associated with the TPVB (i.e. pneumothorax, risk of bleeding in the thoracic paravertebral space, random and unmanageable epidural spread etc.). The investigators have already tested the anatomical- and block execution hypothesis in a randomized cadaveric study, and the investigators now have anatomical proof of concept for the functionality of the block technique. The investigators have also conducted a small clinical pilot study with very promising results. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled and double-blind study, comparing the effect of the ultrasound-guided multiple-injection costotransverse block (MICB) vs. placebo. The aim with this study is to investigate the efficacy of the MICB vs. placebo in patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy and primary reconstructive surgery due to breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. The hypothesis is, that the unilateral MICB will significantly reduce the opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours and significantly reduce the Numerical Rating Scale pain score (0-10) and opioid related side effects."
NCT02864030,"On March 17th, 2011, the European Commission issued a marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union for Eribulin mesylate (Halaven; Eisai Limited), for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least two chemotherapic regimens for advanced disease.

As the use of Eribulin will be widespread in this tumor setting, a better knowledge of its safety profile outside clinical trials is warranted.

Indeed the possibility to select patients at risk for developing Eribulin-induced neuropathy, will allow the exclusion from these treatment of those patients harbouring the specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Given that Eribulin toxicity often results in treatment discontinuation, the ability to anticipate which patients will experience severe toxicity could allow for either early intervention or even possibly for prophylactic therapy, or for selection of the patients to be treated."
NCT00774241,"This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of first line combination treatment with Avastin + docetaxel in patients with HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer.Patients will receive Avastin (15mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) plus docetaxel (75mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles). The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100 individuals."
NCT05072314,"The LOLIPOP Trial is a large (n=4,300 patients) pragmatic, international, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assessment, safety and effectiveness superiority study."
NCT03988114,"The reason for this study is to see if the drug abemaciclib in combination with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole or letrozole) is effective in participants with Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer that have certain disease characteristics."
NCT05420454,"Due to the unique advantages of albumin-bound paclitaxel, several studies in China and abroad have tried to use albumin-bound paclitaxel for neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer up to now. However, comparative studies between paclitaxel and docetaxel are still rare, In this study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted to analyse the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer, and to further analyse the efficacy and safety of albumin paclitaxel in combination with chemotherapy for postoperative breast cancer in different subtypes of breast cancer patients, in order to obtain more realistic data and provide new treatment options for breast cancer patients."
NCT02447328,This single-arm study aims to assess the safety and tolerability profile of Fulvestrant(Faslodex®) as 2nd line and later therapy in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate the adverse events after Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) for about 6 months
NCT03238703,"This pilot clinical trial studies how well endocrine therapy works in treating patients with HER2 negative, low risk breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor modulators may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body."
NCT05840068,The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of metformin as an adjuvant to chemotherapy on IGF levels in both progressing and non progressing cases of metastatic breast cancer in female patients.

NCT05291910,"This is a multi-center, prospective, interventional, single-arm clinical trial. In the study, patients with her2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who were initially treated were included. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Inetetamab combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and albumin-bound paclitaxel for HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer."
NCT02005770,"Serious concern about the role of anesthesia in tumor recurrence has considerably risen over years, but the lack of surrogate markers for tumor spreading made trials addressing this issue difficult to realize. In breast cancer patients CTC positivity has been recently recognized as an independent prognostic factor. In this respect, we postulated that in a first step changes in the number of CTC after general anesthesia would help to determine the effect of anesthesia on this tumor marker."
NCT00172029,"The aim of this prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentric clinical study is to assess the effícacy and tolerability of zoledronic acid 4 mg IV infused over 15 minutes every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions, in combination with standard or reduced dose radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer and metastatic bone disease associated with pain."
NCT05183828,This stage IV trial examines how a mutation in HSD3B1 (1245C) gene affects treatment of stage I-III breast cancer. This trial may help researchers determine if mutations in HSD3B1 decreases the efficacy of aromatase inhibitor therapy such as letrozole. Letrozole may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
NCT00082277,The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety parameters of anastrozole with regard to its potential effects on postmenopausal bone loss and on lipid profiles. This trial is conducted to investigate the effects of risedronate on BMD and on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women using anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer and who are high or moderate risk of fragility fracture. It is also conducted to determine the effects of anastrozole on bone mineral density (BMD) and on bone metabolism in women at low risk of fragility fracture.
NCT03051503,"to determine the safety, efficacy and tolerability of transdermal fentanyl in patients undergoing mastectomy, as well as the postoperative consumption of analgesic."
NCT03676114,"Breast cancer patients often have perioperative emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression, which can lead to poor quality of recovery.This study aims to determine whether ketamine could improve the quality of recovery in breast cancer patients. Meanwhile, it will show if ketamine could improve anxiety, depression, postoperative pain and fatigue.This trial also will bring great concerns on patients' mental health perioperatively and explore the measures to improve their quality of life."
NCT06300099,"Modified radical mastectomy is the most commonly performed surgical approach for breast cancer. The procedure enables surgeons to remove the main tumor mass, adjacent glandular tissue and regional lymph nodes. Moreover, it provides a cosmetic outcome that clearly surpasses the standard radical mastectomy and allows subsequent breast reconstruction with favorable results.

The present randomized study aims to compare the postoperative analgesic effects of dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to serratus anterior plane block in women undergoing modified radical mastectomy."
NCT06252662,Perform a comparison of effective pain relief duration between liposomal bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine when added to bupivacaine in a block for mastectomy for cancer surgery. The erector spinae plane block is a well-established block that is utilized for post operative pain control for procedures performed on the soft tissue of the chest and chest wall as well as intrathoracic procedures. The goal is comparison of the effective duration of both study groups to determine if there is a significant difference in time and amount of post operative opioids required which admitted to hospital.
NCT03360214,"This is a prospective randomized controlled double-blind interventional study comparing the effect of pulsed-electromagnetic field device (PEMF), pectoral interfascial block (PIB), and placebo on postoperative pain control.

NCT03007381,"Background: Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been shown to reduce breakthrough narcotic consumption following orthopaedic, neurosurgical, and obstetrical procedures. The morphine-sparing effect of ketorolac may reduce respiratory and central nervous system depression post operatively, while still providing adequate pain control for patients. Patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction may particularly benefit from ketorolac postoperatively, and ultimately be safely discharged from hospital sooner than their counterparts receiving standard of care.

Research Question: In adult women post-mastectomy, undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction, does a postoperative regimen of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine, in addition to standard of care, reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay compared with an intravenous sham saline regimen?

Study Design: A single center, explanatory, placebo-controlled, 1:1 allocation, 2-arm, parallel group, superiority, randomized, and double blinded, controlled trial.

Population: The study population includes all females \>18 years old post mastectomy consenting to abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction.

Intervention and Comparator: The intervention will be ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours postoperatively for 72 hours. The comparator will be a sham intravenous administration of normal saline.

Outcomes: The primary outcome is hospital length of stay postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include visual analog scale for pain, breakthrough narcotic consumption, surgical drain outputs, hematoma, and other complications.

Sample Size: Available data provided estimates for average length of hospital stay and standard deviation. A minimally clinically significant difference of 1 day was decided on due to expert opinion. Based on a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05, and inflated to account for attrition and efficiency losses, a total of 50 patients (25 per group) will be required for this study."

NCT02816164,"In patients with early-stage breast cancer, chemotherapy has substantially improved survival rates. Improvements in outcomes, however, are compromised by the considerable toxicities associated with chemotherapy, the most notable being neutropenia. Neutropenia is the presence of abnormally few white blood cells, leading to increase susceptibility to infection and can require hospitalization and need for intravenous antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile neutropenia (FN) can also be associated with treatment delays and dose reductions, potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients can receive medication to reduce the risk of FN such as Neupogen (filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5, 7 or 10 days. Since there is genuine uncertainty among healthcare professionals as to which administration schedule of Neupogen is the best for patients, the investigators are performing a randomized study for which patients will receive either 5, 7 or 10 days of Neupogen. Neupogen can cost approximately $200/injection, so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of treatment, this can cost $16,000 compared to a 5 day treatment which would cost half this. In addition to cost savings, many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a daily basis and require nursing resources which are utilized at high cost. This study will use an oral consent model to compare 5, 7 and 10 days of Neupogen to evaluate rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization."
NCT05631795,"The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of alpelisib plus fulvestrant in men and post-menopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer (aBC) with a PIK3CA mutation, whose disease has progressed on or after endocrine-based treatment"
NCT03495609,"Specific aim: To establish the proof of principle that treatment of ""high breast cancer risk"" women with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-hCG) will change their breast epithelium's high risk genomic profile to one similar to that identified in women with a history of early full first term pregnancy."
NCT05843292,"The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the efficacy and safety of short-term sintilimab in combination with taxane and carboplatin for neoadjuvant therapy in female early-stage triple-negative breast caner patients aging from 18 to 70 years with unilateral and invasive primary lesions above 1cm. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does short-term sintilimab in combination with taxane and carboplatin lead to acceptible pathological complete response (pCR) rates, objective response rates (ORR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)?
2. Does short-term sintilimab in combination with taxane and carboplatin lead to less adverse events than regular-term ICIs reported in literature?

Participants will be given 2 cycles of sintilimab, in combination with 4 cycles of taxane and carboplatin before surgery. An optional core-needle biopsy is performed after completing 2 cycles of sintilimab. All participants will be given regular follow-up post surgery according to ASCO guidelines."
NCT01298193,"This is a prospective, multicenter, open label, non-comparative trial in Spain.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the complete response, defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue treatment, in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with one cycle of Docetaxel-Cyclophosphamide and active therapy for the prevention of CINV (Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting) day 1, 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) antagonist plus 3 days of dexamethasone. A second step (efficacy phase) is designed to examine the efficacy and tolerability of aprepitant in the second cycle among patients who failed to the previous CINV prevention treatment.

The study will focus on early-stage chemonaive breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel-cyclophosphamide and a 5-HT3 antagonist plus dexamethasone for the CINV prevention. The CINV incidence in those patients will be evaluated on the first cycle. All refractory patients, will be asked to participate in the second phase, where aprepitant on days 1, 2 and 3 will be added to their antiemetic regimen.

Assuming a drop out of 5%, 212 patients will be included in the study. It is anticipated that around 48 patients will enter the efficacy phase.

The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be approximately 21 months."

NCT01907880,"Metastatic breast cancer patients with bone involvement who are at high-risk of subsequent skeletal related event (SRE), defined as radiotherapy or surgery to the bone, pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia (as reflected through: elevated sCTX or bone pain or a prior SRE despite receiving standard bisphosphonate therapy) should experience a decrease in the surrogate marker, sCTX, at week 12 if switched to zoledronic acid compared with those patients who continue on intravenous pamidronate (i.e. current standard of care). The investigators propose that a drop in sCTX will correlate with improved pain, quality of life and a reduced incidence of further SREs."
NCT05807074,"Improvement in bleeding and bruising has been described by using both intravenous and topical off-label applications of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in many surgical fields. This trial tests how well applying tranexamic acid (TXA) to the surface of the surgical site (topically) works to reduce post-operative bleeding (hematomas) and fluid collections (seromas) in women undergoing surgery to remove both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) immediately followed by surgery to rebuild the breast (reconstruction). The formation of hematomas and seromas, a common post-mastectomy complication, can interfere with breast reconstruction and increase the risk of infection and wound healing and can potentially delay cancer treatments. TXA is a synthetic molecule that pushes the body's clotting cascade toward clot formation to improve blood clotting. Applying TXA topically to the surgical site before closing the incision may prevent hematoma and seroma formation in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction patients.

Participants will be recruited from patients undergoing bilateral mastectomy at University of California, San Francisco."
NCT03456661,"A double blind prospective randomized controlled trial in which the effect of single shot levobupivacaine 0,25% will be compared with the effect of levobupivacaine 0.25% in association with dexmedetomidine when performing an ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve block , in patients undergoing a mastectomy with axillar procedure.

The difference in effect will be evaluated by monitoring the postoperative morphine consumption in both groups .

The hypothesis is that there is a significant decrease in morphine consumption during the first 24h postoperatively due to association of dexmedetomidine to the local anesthetic compared to the local anesthetic alone when performing a ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve block. The morphine consumption will be the primary outcome parameter."

NCT02115282,This randomized phase III trial studies exemestane and entinostat to see how well they work compared to exemestane alone in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or another place in the body (metastatic). Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether exemestane is more effective with or without entinostat in treating breast cancer.
NCT01234337,"The objective of this phase-III trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine in combination with placebo in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer who are resistant to or have failed prior taxane and an anthracycline or for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. After signing consent there can be up to 28 days before starting the treatment during which time a number of tests will be carried out which will include tumor evaluations and medical history. The following tests and evaluations will have to be done within 7 days of the start of treatment,on Day 1 of every cycle and at the end of study: Electrocardiogram, blood tests, patient quality of life questionnaires and a complete physical exam and vital signs. Treatment will be given in 21 day cycles with sorafenib/placebo to be taken every day for 21 days and capecitabine to be taken for the first 14 days. Patients will come in weekly for the first 6 weeks and then on Day1 for every cycle after the first 2 cycles. During the weekly visits the subjects will be check for any side effects and blood draws will happen for the study on Day 1 of each cycle. Subjects will be followed for overall survival."
NCT01953003,"Options for the treatment of patients who have progressed after an anthracycline and a taxane are limited. Capecitabine currently has a role in this setting, yet as many as 80% of patients do not respond to this treatment and those who respond eventually develop clinical resistance.

The antitumour activity of vinflunine has been demonstrated in patients with breast cancer after exposure to anthracycline and to taxane.

Vinflunine plus capecitabine has been shown to be a feasible combination for patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. Each drug in combination can be administered at efficacious doses.

This population has few therapeutic options with established clinical benefit. The development of a new regimen and potential new standard of care for this group is important.

* Primary objective:

  • to compare in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracycline and taxane the efficacy of the combination of vinflunine and capecitabine with capecitabine alone, in terms of progression-free survival.
* Secondary objectives:

  * to evaluate the response rate, the time to response and the duration of response in both arms
  * to compare the disease control rate between arms
  * to evaluate the duration of disease control in both arms
  * to evaluate the overall survival in both arms
  * to evaluate safety

Methodology This multicentre, open-label, randomised, Phase III study will enrol a total of 334 patients with advanced breast cancer who have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive VFL plus capecitabine (Arm A) or capecitabine alone (Arm B)."
NCT01101438,"This study is looking at whether Metformin, an agent that is commonly used to treat diabetes, can decrease or affect the ability of breast cancer cells to grow and whether Metformin will work with other therapies to keep cancer from recurring. Health Canada has not approved the sale or use of Metformin to treat breast cancer, although they have approved its use in this clinical trial. Although Metformin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetes, its use in breast cancer is considered investigational."
NCT00808522,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether hCG will result in a decrease in breast density.

High breast density has been associated with an increased risk in breast cancer. It has also been shown that decreasing density with a drug called tamoxifen has resulted in a decreased risk in breast cancer. The investigators are looking at the effect of hCG on breast density in people who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and our theory postulates that through the hormonal actions of hCG and tamoxifen there would be a greater reduction in breast density in patients who are treated with hCG and tamoxifen versus patients treated with tamoxifen alone. Using this data the investigators will be able to hypothesize that the treatment of hCG will result in a reduction in breast cancer rates in the population and thus make available another drug which can be used to decrease the rates of breast cancer in the population"
NCT00193726,"One of the basic principles of cancer chemotherapy is that these drugs act exclusively or mainly on cells in cycle. Estrogens have been shown to increase the fraction of breast cancer cells in cycle. Tamoxifen on the other hand, decreases the proliferative fraction and has been shown to negatively impact on the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer when given concomitantly. A number of previous studies have attempted estrogenic recruitment of cancer cells (into cell cycle) to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Although some studies showed an increase in response rates in the recruitment arm, there was no benefit in time to progression or survival in any of the studies. These results may have been due to the inadequate sample size of the studies and advanced stage disease (with presumably higher fraction of inherently chemoresistant cells).

NCT05016349,"Investigating the potential role of a novel quadrate combination therapy Mifepristone(Antiprogestrone), Tamoxifen, Retinoic acid and Cannabidiol ( selective cyp 26 inhibitor) for treating early breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the main cause of mortality among women. The disease presents high recurrence mainly due to incomplete efficacy of primary treatment in killing all cancer cells. Therapy resistance remains a major problem in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. Half of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers contain a subpopulation of cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-expressing cells that are therapy resistant and exhibit increased cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Here, we propose a testable hypothesis that treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen or retinoic acid or a combination of the two, may result in induction or conversion of some ER-positive breast cancer cells to ER-negative cancer cells expressing the basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5) via stimulation of progesterone receptors effect, and production . Therefore, we raised an issue with the answer "" Why Antiprogestrone such Mifepristone and cyp 26 inhibitors must be combined with Tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid in the era of oncology for treating early breast cancer"" .In fact, limited evidence has indicated that induction of CK5+ cells in ERα+ breast cancer is a unique effect of progestin (Prg) but many studies have demonstrated that progesterone (P4) increases CK5+ breast cancer cells. In case-cohort study of 405 incident breast cancer cases, elevated circulating progesterone levels were associated with a 16% increase in the risk of breast cancer. A study demonstrated that tamoxifen induced progesterone receptors (PGR) in short term treatment. Another study showed that High progesterone receptor expression correlates to the effect of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients. These CK5-positive cells are therapy resistant and have increased tumor-initiating potential. Also, previous work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive cells which are therapy resistant . Although retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. A study investigated the effects of all-trans-RA (atRA) on progesterone production in immature rat GCs cultured without gonadotropin. demonstrated that atRA enhanced progesterone production by upregulating the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450scc (Cyp11a1). Here, we suggest that tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid must be combined with anti-progesterone (Mifepristone) to achieve treatment with significant effect against early breast cancer. Moreover, Numerous studies have shown that CYP2D6 variant carriers (around 50% CYP2D6 variant carriers in Chinese population) will not benefit a lot from tamoxifen, and combined use of CYP2D6 inhibitors will further affect the efficacy of tamoxifen. In addition, All-trans-retinoic acid acts as an inducer of CYP26A1 expression. Which is the second expected cause of unsuccessful trial of Tamoxifen and retinoic acid in breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, The CYP26 inhibitor also induced expression of atRA-responsive genes. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in microsomes isolated from JEG-3 human placental carcinoma cells. One study found that high retinol was significantly. associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Another found a significant trend of reduced retinol levels with more advanced disease stage.

Therefore we will take the benefit of cyp 26 inhibitor in this trial by combining Cannabidiol, a major phytocannabinoid, as a potent atypical inhibitor for CYP2D6."

NCT01608451,"Randomized Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Progesterone and Vitamin D3 in women with Large Operable Breast Cancer and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer - A Feasibility Study

Primary Progesterone Timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle and its impact on survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer has been extensively researched and reinvestigated by Badwe et al in the randomized clinical trial of 'Primary Progesterone Therapy for Operable Breast Cancer' at Tata Memorial Hospital. The underlying assumption was that the presence of unopposed estrogen (in follicular phase) at the time surgery may be deleterious for survival and that circulating progesterone might counteract this deleterious effect.

Vitamin D3 The most prominent physiological role of hormonally active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol), is regulation of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and bone metabolism via an intracellular receptor (VDR) which is a member of steroid thyroid hormone super-family of receptors. The VDR receptors are also found in other tissues like breast and prostate.

Vitamin D compounds have also been implicated in promotion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells and evidence suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its synthetic analogues may potentiate responsiveness of breast cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic agents.

Objectives

1. To see the effect of primary progesterone on survival in women with high risk breast cancer (large operable and locally advanced breast cancer)
2. To see the effect of Vitamin D3 as an antiproliferative, cytotoxic and apoptotic agent (negative growth regulator) by evaluation of surrogate markers of proliferation and apoptosis.

Inclusion Criteria:

* Unilateral breast cancer
* Large operable breast cancer/LOBC (T3N0M0 or T3N1M0) and Locally advanced breast cancer/LABC (T3N1-2M0; T2N2M0)
* Age \<70 years
* Fit for CT

Exclusion Criteria:

* Prior Incision Biopsy or Excision Biopsy
* Metastatic breast cancer
* Renal failure or deranged Renal Function Test
* Hypoparathyroidism
* Pregnant or lactating mothers or women of childbearing age not practicing contraception
* Patient on any of the following drugs: Magnesium-containing antacids, Digitalis, Phenytoin barbiturates, Thiazide diuretics.
* Previous history of other cancers except cured skin and cervical carcinoma in situ.

Methodology / Treatment plan

NCT05016349,"Investigating the potential role of a novel quadrate combination therapy Mifepristone(Antiprogestrone), Tamoxifen, Retinoic acid and Cannabidiol ( selective cyp 26 inhibitor) for treating early breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the main cause of mortality among women. The disease presents high recurrence mainly due to incomplete efficacy of primary treatment in killing all cancer cells. Therapy resistance remains a major problem in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. Half of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers contain a subpopulation of cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-expressing cells that are therapy resistant and exhibit increased cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Here, we propose a testable hypothesis that treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen or retinoic acid or a combination of the two, may result in induction or conversion of some ER-positive breast cancer cells to ER-negative cancer cells expressing the basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5) via stimulation of progesterone receptors effect, and production . Therefore, we raised an issue with the answer "" Why Antiprogestrone such Mifepristone and cyp 26 inhibitors must be combined with Tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid in the era of oncology for treating early breast cancer"" .In fact, limited evidence has indicated that induction of CK5+ cells in ERα+ breast cancer is a unique effect of progestin (Prg) but many studies have demonstrated that progesterone (P4) increases CK5+ breast cancer cells. In case-cohort study of 405 incident breast cancer cases, elevated circulating progesterone levels were associated with a 16% increase in the risk of breast cancer. A study demonstrated that tamoxifen induced progesterone receptors (PGR) in short term treatment. Another study showed that High progesterone receptor expression correlates to the effect of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients. These CK5-positive cells are therapy resistant and have increased tumor-initiating potential. Also, previous work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive cells which are therapy resistant . Although retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. A study investigated the effects of all-trans-RA (atRA) on progesterone production in immature rat GCs cultured without gonadotropin. demonstrated that atRA enhanced progesterone production by upregulating the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450scc (Cyp11a1). Here, we suggest that tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid must be combined with anti-progesterone (Mifepristone) to achieve treatment with significant effect against early breast cancer. Moreover, Numerous studies have shown that CYP2D6 variant carriers (around 50% CYP2D6 variant carriers in Chinese population) will not benefit a lot from tamoxifen, and combined use of CYP2D6 inhibitors will further affect the efficacy of tamoxifen. In addition, All-trans-retinoic acid acts as an inducer of CYP26A1 expression. Which is the second expected cause of unsuccessful trial of Tamoxifen and retinoic acid in breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, The CYP26 inhibitor also induced expression of atRA-responsive genes. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in microsomes isolated from JEG-3 human placental carcinoma cells. One study found that high retinol was significantly. associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Another found a significant trend of reduced retinol levels with more advanced disease stage. A study showed that intake of vitamin A and retinol could reduce breast cancer risk. Therefore we will take the benefit of cyp 26 inhibitor in this trial by combining Cannabidiol, a major phytocannabinoid, as a potent atypical inhibitor for CYP2D6."

NCT00083304,"RSR13 (efaproxiral) is a radiation sensitizer that has shown positive results in a Phase 3, randomized clinical trial of patients with brain metastases. Of 111 eligible breast cancer patients with brain metastases in that trial, 59 patients who received RSR13 prior to radiation therapy had a median survival time that was twice as long as the 52 patients who did not receive RSR13 prior to radiation therapy.

RSR13 (efaproxiral) is an experimental drug that increases the amount of oxygen released from blood into the tissues. It is well known that certain types of cancer tumors, including those in brain metastases, lack oxygen. Lack of oxygen in a tumor can reduce the effect of radiation therapy (RT). RSR13 may increase the oxygen level in brain tumors so that radiation therapy works better.

This study will enroll up to 360 women with brain metastases from breast cancer, and will evaluate if whole brain radiation therapy given with RSR13 will have a better treatment effect than whole brain radiation therapy alone. RSR13 will be infused intravenously (IV) through a central catheter placed in a central vein.

NCT01608451,"Randomized Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Progesterone and Vitamin D3 in women with Large Operable Breast Cancer and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer - A Feasibility Study

Primary Progesterone Timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle and its impact on survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer has been extensively researched and reinvestigated by Badwe et al in the randomized clinical trial of 'Primary Progesterone Therapy for Operable Breast Cancer' at Tata Memorial Hospital. The underlying assumption was that the presence of unopposed estrogen (in follicular phase) at the time surgery may be deleterious for survival and that circulating progesterone might counteract this deleterious effect.

Vitamin D3 The most prominent physiological role of hormonally active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol), is regulation of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and bone metabolism via an intracellular receptor (VDR) which is a member of steroid thyroid hormone super-family of receptors. The VDR receptors are also found in other tissues like breast and prostate.

Vitamin D compounds have also been implicated in promotion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells and evidence suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its synthetic analogues may potentiate responsiveness of breast cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic agents.

Objectives

1. To see the effect of primary progesterone on survival in women with high risk breast cancer (large operable and locally advanced breast cancer)
2. To see the effect of Vitamin D3 as an antiproliferative, cytotoxic and apoptotic agent (negative growth regulator) by evaluation of surrogate markers of proliferation and apoptosis.

NCT03794388,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Europe. Therefore, breast cancer has become a chronic disease and patients need to learn to live with it as well as with the adverse effects related to the disease itself or to the therapies used.

As noted in the third ""Plan cancer"", pain is a major criterion in the quality of life of patients treated for breast cancer.

Neuropathic pain was defined in 2011 by the international Association for the Study of Pain (I.A.S.P.) as the direct result of a lesion or disease affecting the somato-sensory system.

Surgical treatment is often the first treatment of breast cancer. It can be conservative by performing a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy) or non-preservative by total mastectomy.

Intercostobrachial neuralgia (NICB) or Post mastectomy painful Syndrome (MPRR) was first described by Wood in 1978 as ""chronic pain beginning immediately or early after a mastectomy"" Or a lumpectomy affecting the anterior thorax, armpit and/or arm in its upper half. These post-surgical pains are related to a lesion of the nerves in the breast area.

In particular, the intercostobrachial nerve can be severed, stretched or crushed during surgery.

Post-operative neuropathic pain in patients with breast cancer is underdiagnosed either by general practitioner or in a specialized environment.

The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is performed during examination and clinical examination. Several scales allow to detect neuropathic pain but only the DN4 is recognized to be the most specific and sensitive scale.

Patients do not always express this pain. They do not always reconcile with the surgery. Either because the pain occurs a long time after the surgery, or they find it normal to get hurt. These diagnostic difficulties cause a delay in setting up a suitable analgesic treatment.

However, neuropathic pain responds poorly to common analgesics. Diagnosis, evaluation and early management of neuropathic pain are a priority in order to avoid their chronicization, to improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and to enable them to return to work quickly.

We therefore assume that the diagnosis of early neuropathic pain at 2 months of surgery associated with initiation of appropriate topical treatment without the systemic effects of conventional oral treatments, would reduce the incidence of Chronic neuropathic pain 6 months after surgery."

However, neuropathic pain responds poorly to common analgesics. Diagnosis, evaluation and early management of neuropathic pain are a priority in order to avoid their chronicization, to improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and to enable them to return to work quickly.

We therefore assume that the diagnosis of early neuropathic pain at 2 months of surgery associated with initiation of appropriate topical treatment without the systemic effects of conventional oral treatments, would reduce the incidence of Chronic neuropathic pain 6 months after surgery."

NCT01227408,"The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of neoadjuvant treatment utilizing chemotherapy formulations with favorable toxicity profiles: weekly doxorubicin, PPX and capecitabine. It is expected this combination will at least maintain the efficacy of a traditional chemotherapy regimen but will be associated with less toxicity, particularly nausea, vomiting and alopecia. In order to accomplish this the investigators have designed a chemotherapy regimen whose components (or administration schedule) are associated with minimal or no alopecia and are also considered to have low emetogenic potential.

In an attempt to improve the efficacy of the regimen the investigators plan to study an alternate schedule of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate administration (metronomic chemotherapy) which appears to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore enhance the activity of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered concurrently.

In this trial the investigators aim to determine the clinical and pathologic response rate of 12 weeks of doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of PPX and capecitabine. Metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be administered during the 24 weeks of chemotherapy."

NCT02187991,"The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, alisertib, in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel), can shrink or slow tumor growth in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative or HR-negative, HER2-negative (triple negative) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of breast cancer.

Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the activity of Aurora A kinase, a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this protein can lead to the death of cancer cells.

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer, including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in cancer therapy, combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of the same drugs used alone."

NCT03094052,"This phase II trial studies the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with stage II-IIIC HER2 Positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and neratinib. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving trastuzumab and neratinib may work better in treating patients with stage II-IIIC HER2 positive breast cancer."

NCT01594177,"Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2 positive disease trastuzumab is given simultaneously. Neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy given simul-taneously with trastuzumab achieves a pCR rate of approx. 40%. Recent data showed that a double blockade of the HER2 receptor (e.g. trastuzumab + lapatinib; trastuzumab + pertuzumab) given together with a few cycles of chemotherapy can increase the pCR rate by approximately 20%. So far, there is uncertainty, if afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible HER family blocker can lead to an even more complete blockade of the HER2 pathway when given in combination with trastuzumab. The neoadjuvant setting provides the unique opportunity to assess precisely and at short term the effect of systemic treatment by assessing the pCR at surgery. It also allows treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer before surgery without standard trastuzumab treatment, as, according to current guideline, trastuzumab can also be given sequentially after surgery. The aim of the study is to show that chemotherapy + trastuzumab + afatinib can achieve significant pCR rates."

NCT00303615,"This study is for patients with breast cancer that has spread to other tissues and organs. The purpose of this study is to identify patients who may respond favorably to certain types of hormonal therapy. Researchers will study your tumor, which was removed during your breast surgery. They will look for the presence or absence of Androgen (AR) receptors. These tests are for research purposes only. They will not affect the treatment of your breast cancer. The presence or absence of Androgen receptors on the tumor does not alter the therapy that is offered to patients. Recent evidence suggests that AR+ tumors are more likely to be destroyed when treated with androgen drugs. We will ask about 35 ER-/PR- breast cancer patients from Legacy Health System to be in this study. All tests and procedures are done as an outpatient in the doctor's office, a clinic, or at the hospital. The study drug that will be used in this trial is Androxy®, a synthetic androgen hormone. Androgens have been shown to inhibit the growth of some breast cancer cells. Arimidex is an aromatase inhibitor that will be used in conjunction with Androxy to inhibit the in vivo production of estrogen. It is hoped that the combination of these two drugs will inhibit the growth of your tumor and possibly cause it to shrink."
NCT03931928,"In hormone-receptor positive breast cancer or DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) tamoxifen remains an important treatment option for patients before menopause and those patients after menopause who cannot be treated with aromatase-inhibitors. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of patients suffer a relapse of their cancer while on treatment with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a drug that is metabolized to a variety of compounds by the human liver, and the most important antihormonally active metabolite is called (Z)-Endoxifen. It is known that patients who have a reduced or absent activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 have lower levels of (Z)-Endoxifen. Furthermore, it has been observed that patients on tamoxifen therapy who have absent CYP2D6 activity are at a 2-fold increased risk for disease recurrence, and patients with lower CYP2D6 compared to patients with normal CYP2D6 activity still have a 1.4-fold increased risk for disease recurrence.

This trial will include patients who are already on tamoxifen therapy for at least 3 months and is designed to show that in patients with absent or low CYP2D6 activity, (Z)-Endoxifen supplementation - that is giving (Z)-Endoxifen in addition to tamoxifen for the study period of 42 days - can increase blood levels of (Z)-Endoxifen to therapeutic concentrations. It is planned to included 504 patients in this blinded, randomized trial, which will have a placebo group (receiving no (Z)-Endoxifen) and two intervention groups that will receive 0, 1.5 or 3 mg (Z)-Endoxifen depending on their CYP2D6 genetics or their (Z)-Endoxifen levels at the start of the study.

The trial is not designed to evaluate outcome measures (that is recurrence or survival rates) of (Z)-Endoxifen supplementation in tamoxifen treated patients, but will document the safety of the combined administration of tamoxifen and (Z)-Endoxifen."

NCT01847001,"This study is being conducted in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer that will be undergoing chemotherapy prior to surgery - neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study involves treatment with standard chemotherapy and a commonly used, FDA-approved, blood pressure drug called propranolol (Inderal). The purposes of this study are to:

1. Determine the effect of propranolol plus chemotherapy on breast cancer cells as well as the growth of blood vessels surrounding breast cancer cells.
2. Determine the side effect profile of propranolol and chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

This research is being done because previous laboratory work has shown that propranolol may decrease the ability for the blood vessels around breast cancer cells to grow, which may be important in helping cancer cells grow. It also may reduce the likelihood for breast cancer cells to spread. If changes are seen in the breast cancer cells and surrounding blood vessels in this study, we will pan to evaluate whether propranolol decreases the likelihood of breast cancer from recurring in future, later studies.

According to the literature, incidence can vary from 4 to 89% depending on the type of surgery, whether or not a drain is inserted or a compression dressing applied and the time at which the drain is removed... In our experience, the incidence is 40% \[IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute) data focusing on 70 patients between November 2008 and February 2009\]

Encouraging results in terms of reducing postoperative lymphoceles as well as drainage duration and volume using Octreotide have been recorded in two recent studies. A new molecule developed by Novartis Laboratories, namely pasireotide, is a somatostatin analog possessing strong affinity for several somatostatin receptors (30 to 40 times greater for sst1 and sst5, 5 times greater for sst3 and equivalent for sst2)

The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a pre-surgical injection of pasireotide LAR in reducing the postoperative incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles following axillary node dissection.

The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of prolonged release pasireotide on the duration of postoperative drainage, the daily drainage volume, the total drainage volume, the number of repeated lymphocele aspirations and the volume, the total volume of lymph aspirated, the incidence of postoperative febrile episodes, the length of hospital stay, and the length of time to onset of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that has progressed since their previous cancer treatment and that cannot be removed completely by surgery are eligible to be treated within this trial.Treatment with a new drug called Progesterone Receptor Antagonist ZK 230211 (ZK PRA) targets the progesterone receptor which may be expressed on breast cancer tumour cells. Therefore only patients with this progesterone receptor on their tumour cells can be included in this study.Progesterone receptor antagonists (including onapristone) have already shown efficacy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (Klijn et al. 2000). This phase II study investigates the efficacy (proof of concept), safety and tolerability of ZK PRA at two dose levels (25 mg and 100 mg) before initiating pivotal phase III trials."
NCT04356209,"Conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the therapeutic standard for patient with Breast Cancer. Symptoms are common among patients receiving this treatment. Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL) remains discussed.

To date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.

Since 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.

Patients can now benefit from this new anti-fibrotic agent.

Taken as a whole, these data encourage combining both drug (pravastatin) and non-pharmacological intervention , in particular e-PRO, in the RIF management."

NCT02595372,"In preliminary laboratory science studies, the investigators show that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) effectively inhibit human fatty acid synthase (FASN) and breast cancer cell survival. A preliminary retrospective study shows that PPI usage in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival. The impact was most striking in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, PPIs may be repositioned as safe and effective breast cancer drugs to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.

Many of the hurdles that slow progress from target, to lead compound, to investigational agent, to standard therapy are not barriers for the PPIs. The PPIs are FDA-approved, chronically used, and well tolerated so the investigators can move quickly from the laboratory to a proof of concept clinical trial. Incorporating the PPIs into standard care will require more than the investigators propose here, but the investigators have already plotted the additional steps needed to truly impact patient care. If successful, the data gathered in this proposal will lend support to and guide development of a definitive randomized trial."

NCT02203513,"Background:

* All cells go through cycles which allow them to divide. In normal cells, checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) (CHEK 2 (Chk1/2) stop cell division at various points to allow any damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be repaired.
* When Chk1/2 are not present, cells stop dividing and eventually die. Chk1/2 Inhibitor (Prexasertib (LY2606368) blocks the Chk1/2 proteins.
* Researchers hope that by blocking Chk1/2, it will cause tumor cells to die, thereby shrinking tumors.

Objective:

- To see if LY2606368 helps shrink tumors in patients with certain breast, ovarian or prostate cancers.

Eligibility:

- Participants at least 18 years old with breast or ovarian cancer. They must have a mutation in BRCA1 BReast CAncer gene 1 and BRCA2 BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA1/2) genes for group 1, high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 2, or triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 3, or prostate cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 4.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test, scans, and X-rays. They will have a piece of their tumor removed at entry (computed tomography (CT)-assisted biopsy).
* Study Day 1: Participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They may have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

NCT01708798,"Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines are commonly used to treat breast cancer and other types of cancer. Unfortunately, they can cause heart muscle damage, resulting in scarring, abnormal contraction and relaxation, and heart failure symptoms. This side effect occurs more frequently at higher doses, and limits the total dose that can be given to cancer patients. Eplerenone is an oral medication that prevents or reverses heart damage in other disease states, and is commonly used to treat heart failure. This study will investigate the use of eplerenone to protect the heart from these harmful side effects of doxorubicin.

Few therapies have been shown to prevent heart damage in patients receiving anthracyclines. Small studies have suggested that other heart failure medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) may reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity, but eplerenone and other drugs in its class (aldosterone antagonists) have not previously been studied. Eplerenone inhibits enzyme pathways that cause scarring of the heart, and animal studies suggest that anthracyclines cause damage through these same pathways.

This study aims to investigate whether eplerenone protects the heart from the harmful effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy. Specifically, it will measure the effect that eplerenone has on heart muscle relaxation. It will randomly assign women undergoing chemotherapy with doxorubicin to one of two groups: one group will receive eplerenone, and the other group will receive placebo (sugar) pills. The subjects will not know which type of pills they are taking. Heart muscle relaxation will be measured at baseline, after completion of chemotherapy (8-12 weeks), and after 6 months. There will also be various blood tests measured in the study subjects, to determine whether there might be certain blood tests that identify patients at particularly high risk of heart toxicity after doxorubicin therapy."

NCT02142959,"Radiation dermatitis is experienced by almost all patients (up to 95%) receiving radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching and rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant efficacy. Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of radiation dermatitis.

Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients undergoing radiation therapy.

NCT03094052,"This phase II trial studies the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with stage II-IIIC HER2 Positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and neratinib. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving trastuzumab and neratinib may work better in treating patients with stage II-IIIC HER2 positive breast cancer."

NCT02067741,"SAKK 21/12 is a stratified, multicenter Phase II first in-human trial with transdermal CR1447 (4-OH-testosterone) and is directed to patients with endocrine responsive-HER2neg and TN-ARpos metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

The trial will be conducted in Switzerland with max. 90 patients. CR1447 has a very good safety and tolerability profile and combines two mechanisms of action, interaction with the AR and the aromatase enzyme may have a higher activity than drugs with a single mechanism and might offer the possibility of non-chemotherapy based endocrine therapy to the limited treatment options in TN-ARpos BC. Transdermal application of CR1447 might have the advantage to continuously release of 4-OHT into the blood stream, thus omitting a first pass effect.

In Phase II the main objective is to assess activity and to determine the efficacy and tolerability of CR1447. Phase II will consist of two strata, into which patients will be stratified according to their hormonal receptor status: Stratum A for patients with endocrine responsive-HER2neg disease, regardless of their AR status and Stratum B for patients with triple-negative and determined ARpos disease. Patients with triple-negative disease tested negative for AR will be excluded from the trial.

In both strata patients will be treated with 400 mg of CR1447 until disease progression, patients' wish or physicians' decision to end treatment. Biopsies of one defined metastatic lesion in those patients who gave informed consent will be performed at baseline and within the third week of treatment with CR1447.

Measurement of AR expression, expression of downstream targets of ERα, ERβ, PR, AR, angiogenesis and other translational studies as described in this protocol should help confirming the hypothesis of an increased benefit of CR1447 due to its dual action, efficacy of topical application, tolerability and in deciding whether one should proceed to a large randomized trial."

Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.

The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel."

The investigators propose to develop a phase Ib trial with the combination of docetaxel with LDE225 in TN ABC patients to define the safety, tolerability and RP2D, as well as to have some information about the efficacy of the combination."
NCT03861403,"This is a Phase 1b/2a dose escalation and expansion, multi-center study to be conducted in 2 phases:

* Phase 1b

  * Dose Escalation Part 1 (Doublet Therapy)
  * Dose Escalation Part 2 (Triplet Therapy)
* Phase 2a

  * Dose Expansion (Triplet Therapy)

Approximately 125 adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study. It is expected that approximately 24 patients will be enrolled in up to 4 cohorts, 2 cohorts in Dose Escalation Part 1 and 2 cohorts in Dose Escalation Part 2, of up to 6 patients per cohort. Up to 98 additional patients will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase of the study to achieve 88 evaluable patients (i.e., received at least 1 dose of study drug(s) and have 1 evaluable post-baseline modified RECIST v1.1 tumor response assessment; for mCRPC, assessment of soft tissue response will be per modified RECIST v1.1 and bone progression assessment will be per PCWG3 guidelines or discontinued treatment due to death, toxicity, or clinical progression) over 4 independent expansion groups.In either phase (1b or 2a), patients discontinuing for reasons unrelated to study treatment toxicity prior to completion of Cycle (C) 1 may be replaced to achieve the number of required evaluable patients per cancer type following consultation with the Sponsor. Data from each cohort in the Dose Escalation phase will be evaluated independently for safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation and again prior to the Dose Expansion phase."
NCT02646748,"This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b platform study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (Part 1a) and subjects with selected solid tumors (Part 1b and Part 2). Two treatment groups (Group A and Group B) will be evaluated

Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity itacitinib (INCB039110) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each combination.

Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with select solid tumor types will be enrolled into safety expansion cohorts based upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for each combination.

Part 2 utilizes a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate INCB050465 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a 1 stage design to evaluate the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer (UC)."

This amplified and directed immune response could result in anti-tumor responses."
NCT03505528,"This phase 1b study will determine the safety and efficacy of combined treatment of Abraxane and phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

Participants may be eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer or inoperable locally advanced breast cancer.

All participants will receive a combination of intravenous Abraxane and an oral dose of phenelzine sulfate. Abraxane will be administered weekly for the first 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle for 3 consecutive cycles. Phenelzine sulfate will be taken daily for the duration of the 3 cycles. Five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively increasing dose of phenelzine sulfate. Safety and efficacy will be assessed weekly over the 3 cycles of treatment.

Although both drugs have been used in clinical care for more than a decade, they have not been intentionally combined together in a cancer therapy setting. This means that the combined effect of these two drugs has not been documented. This is being addressed in this study."
NCT03566485,"This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of idasanutlin when given together with atezolizumab, and to see how well atezolizumab and cobimetinib or idasanutlin work in treating participants with stage IV estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, or ER+ breast cancer that has come back (recurrent) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib and idasanutlin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving atezolizumab with cobimetinib or atezolizumab with idasanutlin may work better in treating participants with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer."

Berzosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving M6620 and radiation therapy may kill tumor cells more effectively than radiation alone or shrink or stabilize breast cancer for longer than radiation therapy alone."
NCT00001944,"Tumor resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major problem in cancer treatment. Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein.

Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X-rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.

Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.

At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.)

Physical examination, blood tests, and other procedures may be done periodically to monitor treatment."

NCT02074878,"This is a Phase 1 Trial. Crizotinib is a medication that is taken by mouth. It has shown that it can help slow down or stop the growth of tumor cells. The marketing name of the drug is ""Xalkori"". It has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to treat other types of metastatic cancer, but the investigators believe it may be helpful to treat breast cancer as well.

Sunitinib is the other medication used in the study. It is also taken by mouth in the form of a capsule. The marketing name of this drug is ""Sutent"". It too has been approved by the FDA to treat other types of cancer, but not for breast cancer.

One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 200 mg, twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg once a day.

One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg, twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg once a day, and One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg, twice daily with Sunitinib 37.5 mg once a day."
NCT01271920,"The phase Ib part of the trial will assess the MTD of AUY922 in combination with Trastuzumab in patients with Trastuzumab-refractory locally advanced or metastatic HER2+. The MTD is defined as the highest drug dosage not causing in the first cycle of treatment (28 days) medically unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

The phase II part of the trial will assess any potential effect on efficacy of adding AUY922 to Trastuzumab in patients with Trastuzumab-refractory locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.

Both AUY922 and Trastuzumab will be administered as a weekly IV infusion. Treatment should be continued as long as the patient does not have disease progression and tolerates the treatment. The following reasons are examples of acceptable reasons for discontinuing the study; tumor progression (by RECIST, as assessed by the investigator), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study for any other reason, such as patient refusal, withdrawn consent, lost to follow-up or investigator decision."
NCT05092373,"This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of tumor treating fields therapy in combination with either cabozantinib or nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax that have spread to other parts of the body (advanced). Tumor treating fields therapy on this study utilizes NovoTTF systems that are wearable devices that use electrical fields at different frequencies that may help stop the growth of tumor cells by interrupting cancer cells' ability to divide. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tumor treating fields therapy in combination with either cabozantinib, or with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab may help control advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax."

NCT03709446,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents about 15% of breast cancers and is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 non-amplification. Women with TNBC tend to be younger, African American, and BRCA-1 germline carriers. The hallmark of this subtype is early metastatic recurrences with a peak frequency 1-2 years. Prognosis for metastatic TNBC is especially poor with median survival of about 1 year as compared to about 2-4 years with other types of metastatic breast cancer.

The primary objective of the phase I part of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of leflunomide in women with previously treated TNBC (or ER+ , HER2-neg MBC in Phase I). The primary objective of the phase 2 part of this study is to determine the efficacy of leflunomide in patients with TNBC.

Leflunomide, which will be taken daily by mouth, is an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). This proposal will test if DHODH is a novel target for a particular subset of women with metastatic TNBC."
NCT00354900,"There is an intimate relationship between processes which promote growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancers, and processes which regulate blood clotting. The enzymes uPA and PAI-1 are key regulators of the remodeling of recently formed blood clots, and there is substantial information linking greater levels of uPA and PAI-1 in breast cancers with a greater likelihood of breast cancer recurrence and death. As uPA and PAI-1 are excellent markers for a cancer's aggressive clinical behavior, uPA and PAI-1 may be potential targets for anticancer therapy. Aprotinin is an inhibitor of uPA activation, and has been approved by the FDA to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Studies in animals and limited studies in patients have shown that Aprotinin slows the growth of tumors. Our hypothesis is that uPA is chronically activated in malignancies, and that inhibition of uPA by Aprotinin would slow the rate of progression of breast cancer."
NCT03344536,"The purpose of a phase Ib study is to find out the best or maximum tolerated dose of a medication or combination of medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to decide the best dose of the study drug, Debio 1347, that can be given in combination with the standard hormonal drug, fulvestrant. Debio 1347 and fulvestrant could shrink the cancer but it could also cause side effects.

NCT00508586,"Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in metastatic breast cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when administered orally in combination with anastrozole (Arimidex®), letrozole (Femara®), or exemestane (Aromasin®) to women with metastatic breast cancer."
NCT05673200,"This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ASTX727 when given in combination with a usual approach of treatment with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer."

The study is divided in two parts:

Phase I: an open-label, dose escalation study of F16IL2 in combination with doxorubicin for patients with solid tumors.

NCT04142554,"The purpose of this research study is to find the lowest dose of the cancer drug parsaclisib that has an effect on the type of breast cancer a participant has. Researchers are looking at how Parsaclisib affects the immune system. They want to learn whether and how it helps the immune system to find cancer cells to fight them.

Parsaclisib is an oral drug that limits the effects of a protein called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3K). By limiting P13K, parsaclisib can block certain cells that prevent the immune cells from working. As a result, it may help the body's immune system to fight tumors. Parsaclisib is being studied in several clinical trials to treat different types of cancers. Parsaclisib has not yet been approved by FDA for the treatment of cancer.

Studies have shown that a good way to find out how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer drugs is through a pre-operative window study. In this type of study, tissue and blood are collected before treatment. Then subjects receive a study drug for a few weeks before surgery. Blood is drawn during the course of treatment, and leftover tissue is collected during surgery. Comparing the tissue and blood before and after treatment shows the effects the study drug may have had on the tumor.

Research shows that cancers differ when you look at the DNA and RNA (genetic codes) that are inside a cancer cell. DNA and RNA carry genetic information that can determine traits in humans (such as eye color, height, reaction to treatment, etc.), as well as the traits of cancer cells. Depending on the genetic profile (particularly DNA and RNA) of the cancer, it may respond differently to parsaclisib. In this study, the investigators will look at the genetic profile of a participant's tumor by studying tissue and blood samples collected before and after receiving treatment."

Only patients with confirmed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 1q21.3 copy number amplification who successfully meet study eligibility criteria will be enrolled.

The phase Ib segment will be carried out in a standard 3+3 design, with a projected enrolment of 3 to 18 patients to determine the RP2D. In the phase II portion, 2 parallel cohorts will be enrolled (Cohort A: 1q21.3 amplified breast cancers, Cohort B: 1q21.3 amplified other solid tumors). Based on the Simon 2 stage optimal design, 12 patients will be enrolled in each cohort for stage I of the study, and assessed for PFS. If at least 3 of 12 patients meet study response criteria, the study will then be expanded to stage 2 to include a total of 25 patients in each cohort. Accounting for 10% attrition rate, a maximum of 28 patients will be enrolled into each cohort for phase II of the study."
NCT01697293,"This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of triciribine phosphate when given together with paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage IIB-IV breast cancer. Triciribine phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving triciribine phosphate with paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide may be a better treatment for breast cancer."
