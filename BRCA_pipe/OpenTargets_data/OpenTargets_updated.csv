Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein.

Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X-rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.

Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.

At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.)

Physical examination, blood tests, and other procedures may be done periodically to monitor treatment.","yes"

It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer.

This phase II study investigates the efficacy (proof of concept), safety and tolerability of ZK PRA at two dose levels (25 mg and 100 mg) before initiating pivotal phase III trials.","yes"

The primary objectives of this study were:

1- to evaluate the effects of orally administered reparixin on CSCs in the primary tumor and the tumoral microenvironment in an early breast cancer population:

A. CSC were measured in tissue samples by techniques that could include: ALDEFLUOR assay and assessment of CD44/CD24 by flow cytometry, or examination of RNA transcripts by RT-PCR, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1, CD44/CD24 and epithelial mesenchymal transition markers (Snail, Twist, Notch) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). CSC were defined as ALDEFLUOR positive (ALDH-1+) and/or CD44 high/CD24 low by flow cytometry or RT-PCR and IHC and by the detection of ALDH-1+ cells with or without epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor in IHC assays.

B. Serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and chemokine receptor-1 (CXCR1) levels were measured in tissue samples by IHC.

C. Measurement of markers of inflammation (interleukin-1beta \[IL-1β\], interleukin-6 \[IL-6\], interleukin-8 \[IL-8\], tumor necrosis factor-alpha \[TNF-α\], granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor \[GM-CSF\], vascular endothelial growth factor \[VEGF\], basic fibroblast growth factor \[b-FGF\] and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein \[hsCRP\]) in plasma, leukocyte subsets (enumerate T subsets, B, and natural killer/natural killer T \[NK/NKT\] cells) and study polymorphonuclear leukocyte \[PMN\] biology in peripheral blood samples. D. Measurement of markers of angiogenesis (CD31 staining), tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (CD4, CD8, NK and macrophages), autophagy (P62 and LC3 by IHC), EpCAM and EMT markers (CD326, CD45, Twist1, SNAIL1, SLUG, ZEB1, FOXC2, TG2, Akt2, P13k and CK19 by RT-PCR) and tissue cellularity (residual disease characterization in tumor bed) in tumor tissue samples.

2. To evaluate the safety of oral reparixin administered three times daily (t.i.d.) for 21 consecutive days.

Vinflunine plus capecitabine has been shown to be a feasible combination for patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. Each drug in combination can be administered at efficacious doses.

This population has few therapeutic options with established clinical benefit. The development of a new regimen and potential new standard of care for this group is important.

* Primary objective:

  • to compare in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracycline and taxane the efficacy of the combination of vinflunine and capecitabine with capecitabine alone, in terms of progression-free survival.
* Secondary objectives:

  * to evaluate the response rate, the time to response and the duration of response in both arms
  * to compare the disease control rate between arms
  * to evaluate the duration of disease control in both arms
  * to evaluate the overall survival in both arms
  * to evaluate safety

Methodology This multicentre, open-label, randomised, Phase III study will enrol a total of 334 patients with advanced breast cancer who have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane.

* Researchers hope that by blocking Chk1/2, it will cause tumor cells to die, thereby shrinking tumors.

Objective:

- To see if LY2606368 helps shrink tumors in patients with certain breast, ovarian or prostate cancers.

Eligibility:

- Participants at least 18 years old with breast or ovarian cancer. They must have a mutation in BRCA1 BReast CAncer gene 1 and BRCA2 BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA1/2) genes for group 1, high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 2, or triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 3, or prostate cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 4.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test, scans, and X-rays. They will have a piece of their tumor removed at entry (computed tomography (CT)-assisted biopsy).
* Study Day 1: Participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They may have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
* Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle: Participants will receive the study drug through an intravenous (IV).
* Vital signs will be checked before and after. An ECG will be done within 1 hour after.
* Day 15 and Day 28: Participants will have a physical exam, blood drawn, and a 12 lead ECG.
* Cycle 1: Participants will have weekly phone calls and blood draws. Participants may have another CT-assisted biopsy at the end of cycle 1.
* Cycle 2 and beyond, blood will be drawn every other week for routine blood tests.
* Participants will have an after-study visit with a physical exam and blood tests. Participants may have another biopsy when they progressed on treatment. They will have scans of the chest, pelvis, and abdomen and a 12 lead ECG.","yes"

Treatment arms are olaparib monotherapy, olaparib+ Ceralasertib and olaparib+adavosertib. The study subject population will be divided into Stratum A, Stratum B, and Stratum C. Due to the different schedules of administration of each of the treatment options as well as their different toxicity profiles, the study is not blinded. Study has two stage consent process- stage 1 consent (molecular screening for HRR defects) and stage 2 consent (main study). Patients with TNBC and with known qualifying BRCAm, non BRCAm HRRm and non HRRm status will be offered the option of consenting to the main part of the study within the 28-day screening period. Following the ISRC meeting on 17 April 2019 a recommendation was made to close the adavosertib+olaparib treatment arm across all biomarker strata.

Also, previous work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive cells which are therapy resistant .

Also, previous work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive cells which are therapy resistant . Although retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. A study investigated the effects of all-trans-RA (atRA) on progesterone production in immature rat GCs cultured without gonadotropin. demonstrated that atRA enhanced progesterone production by upregulating the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450scc (Cyp11a1). Here, we suggest that tamoxifen or its combination with retinoic acid must be combined with anti-progesterone (Mifepristone) to achieve treatment with significant effect against early breast cancer. Moreover, Numerous studies have shown that CYP2D6 variant carriers (around 50% CYP2D6 variant carriers in Chinese population) will not benefit a lot from tamoxifen, and combined use of CYP2D6 inhibitors will further affect the efficacy of tamoxifen. In addition, All-trans-retinoic acid acts as an inducer of CYP26A1 expression. Which is the second expected cause of unsuccessful trial of Tamoxifen and retinoic acid in breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, The CYP26 inhibitor also induced expression of atRA-responsive genes. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in microsomes isolated from JEG-3 human placental carcinoma cells. One study found that high retinol was significantly. associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Another found a significant trend of reduced retinol levels with more advanced disease stage. A study showed that intake of vitamin A and retinol could reduce breast cancer risk. Therefore we will take the benefit of cyp 26 inhibitor in this trial by combining Cannabidiol, a major phytocannabinoid, as a potent atypical inhibitor for CYP2D6.","yes"

The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.","yes"

The formation of hematomas and seromas, a common post-mastectomy complication, can interfere with breast reconstruction and increase the risk of infection and wound healing and can potentially delay cancer treatments. TXA is a synthetic molecule that pushes the body's clotting cascade toward clot formation to improve blood clotting. Applying TXA topically to the surgical site before closing the incision may prevent hematoma and seroma formation in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction patients.
