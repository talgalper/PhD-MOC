This folder contains the PocketMiner dataset with 38 annotated cryptic pocket examples as well as 'negative examples.'

The Excel file from the manuscript contains a mapping from apo (ligand-free) to holo (ligand-bound) structures, statistics about the pocket opening examples, as well as a classification for each cryptic pocket.

The `apo-structures` folder contains the cleaned apo structures (e.g., structures with missing loops modeled in) which can be used as input to models.

The `all-structures` folder contains all the structures, including holo structures with their bound ligands.
